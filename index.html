      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This documentation explains the workings of the Rahmania Mailing Cost Calculator web application. The calculator determines mailing costs based on a letter's weight, with rates set according to Rahmania's postal rules. This version is deployed as a Flask web application, making it accessible online.</p>

      <h2>Test Data</h2>
      <p>The following chart shows 10 examples of inputs with the output and we can use this to test the application:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Test Case</th><th>Weight (g)</th><th>Expected Cost (sinas)</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>40</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>30</td><td>40</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>31</td><td>55</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>50</td><td>55</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5</td><td>51</td><td>70</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6</td><td>100</td><td>70</td></tr>

      <h2>Algorithm & Flowchart</h2>
      <p>The following algorithm explains how the mailing program calculates the cost based on weight:</p>
      
      <ol style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
        <li><strong>Input:</strong> Prompt the user for the mass of the letter (in grams).</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate Cost Based on Weight:</strong>
          <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>If weight is 30 grams or less, set cost to 40 sinas.</li>
            <li>If weight is between 30 grams and 50 grams, set cost to 55 sinas.</li>
            <li>If weight is between 50 grams and 100 grams, set cost to 70 sinas.</li>
            <li>If weight is over 100 grams:
              <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Set the base cost to 70 sinas.</li>
                <li>Add 25 sinas for each additional 50 grams (or part thereof) above 100 grams.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> Display the calculated mailing cost.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Code Explanation</h2>
      <p>This program was made with Python and Flask. Flask is used to deploy the application and provide a web interface, while Python handles the core functionalities. Below is the code explanation for the program:</p>
      
      <pre><code>
    1. <strong>Imports:</strong>
       - Standard and external libraries are imported for various functionalities:
         - `os`, `csv`, `requests` handle file and API operations.
         - `Flask` and `flask` modules manage the web application, routing, sessions, and responses.
    
    2. <strong>Application Setup:</strong>
       - The application is created with `app = Flask(__name__)`.
       - `app.secret_key` secures the session data used to store the user's mailing history.
    
    3. <strong>Utility Functions:</strong>
       - `convert_to_grams(mass, unit)`: Converts any weight unit (grams, kilograms, ounces, pounds) into grams. This is essential for a standardized cost calculation.
       - `calculate_mail_cost(mass)`: Calculates mailing costs based on the provided mass in grams. Costs are assigned depending on weight thresholds:
         - Up to 30 grams: base cost of 40.
         - Up to 50 grams: base cost of 55.
         - Up to 100 grams: base cost of 70.
         - Above 100 grams: a base cost is applied for the first 100 grams, and additional weight is charged at 25 TRY for every 50 grams.
       - `convert_currency(amount, target_currency)`: Converts the calculated cost from TRY to another specified currency using exchange rates fetched from an external API. If the API request fails, it returns a conversion error message.
    
    4. <strong>Main Route</strong> (`@app.route("/")`):
       - <em>`index()` Function:</em> This handles the main logic of the application.
         - When the page is accessed via `GET`, it renders the form.
         - When the page is accessed via `POST` (form submission), it retrieves and validates user inputs (`mass`, `unit`, and `currency`).
         - The weight is converted to grams and passed to `calculate_mail_cost` for a cost calculation.
         - The calculated cost in TRY is converted into the user-specified currency using `convert_currency`.
         - The cost breakdown and converted total are displayed to the user.
         - Each calculation is stored in the session history for easy retrieval and export.
    
    5. <strong>Clear History Route</strong> (`@app.route("/clear_history")`):
       - Clears the session history by resetting it to an empty list.
       - Redirects back to the main page after clearing.
    
    6. <strong>Export to CSV Route</strong> (`@app.route("/export_csv")`):
       - Generates a CSV file of the user's calculation history.
       - The CSV file contains columns for weight, cost, and a detailed breakdown.
       - CSV data is dynamically generated and returned as a downloadable file with headers for appropriate file type.
    
    7. <strong>Code Flow:</strong>
       - The user accesses the main page and inputs their package details.
       - The weight is converted, and costs are calculated based on weight thresholds.
       - The result is shown, and users have options to clear history or export calculations.
    
    8. <strong>Security Considerations:</strong>
       - `app.secret_key` secures session data.
       - The application is configured to run on host `0.0.0.0` for general accessibility.
    
    9. <strong>Flask Run Configuration:</strong>
       - `if __name__ == "__main__"`: Ensures the app runs directly with `python app.py`.
       - Configures port `808` for local development or deployment environments.
